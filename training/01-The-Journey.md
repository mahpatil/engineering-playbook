# 📖 Module 1: The Journey - Why We're Here

## The Story: From Monolith to Cloud

**2010:** Your company **launches** a successful web application. A single codebase handles everything—user management, orders, payments, inventory, notifications. Your team is **5 developers**. Deployments are simple. Everyone understands the whole system.

**2015:** Business is **booming**. You have **20 developers**. Merging code is painful. A **typo** in the payment module **crashed the entire system** last month, taking down users and orders with it. You want to scale the order processing for the holiday season, but scaling requires deploying the entire app—which means re-testing everything.

**2020:** Now you have **50 developers across 8 teams**. A single **deployment takes 3 months** to coordinate. Teams step on each other's toes constantly. New developers take weeks to understand the codebase. A bug in the notification system brings down your entire platform. Your deployment cycle can't keep up with competitors who ship daily.

**2024:** Time to change. You're **losing market share** to faster competitors. Your **cloud bills are 3x** what they should be because you're over-provisioned. Your best engineers are leaving because the codebase is impossible to work with.

**This is the monolith crisis.** And it's why cloud-native and microservices exist.

## Why Microservices?

The challenges of growing organizations with monolithic systems led to a fundamental shift in how we build software. Microservices aren't just about technology—they're about 
- enabling **team independence**,
- **faster deployment** cycles,
- **localized errors** and
- **cost efficient** resource utilization.
